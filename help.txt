// Android Studio gradle issue
An error indicating "A problem occurred starting process 'command 'node''" during a Gradle sync in a React Native project is a frequent issue that can be resolved. This error, particularly when it mentions react-native-gesture-handler, points to the Gradle build process being unable to locate the Node.js executable.This problem often arises because Android Studio, when launched from a graphical user interface, may not inherit the PATH environment variable from your shell, which is where the location of the Node.js executable is defined.

On macOS:
1.Close Android Studio completely.
2.Open your Terminal application.
3.Execute the following command:
open -a /Applications/Android\ Studio.app
